# Design Rationale for DoseFinder Hub Survey Questions
This document outlines the rationale behind the survey questions used in the DoseFinder Hub, focusing on how each question contributes to the recommendation of dose-finding trial designs. The current questionnaire includes nine questions, of which questions 6–9 directly influence the recommendation engine. Moving forward, additional questions will be incorporated into the recommendation logic, grouped into four key categories:

<b>Categories Influencing Trial Design Recommendations<b/>:
- Performance Metrics (e.g., efficacy, safety, statistical power)
- Operational Constraints (e.g., timeline, budget, regulatory requirements)
- Study Population Characteristics
- Infrastructure Capabilities
Each question is mapped to one or more trial designs—3+3, CRM (Continual Reassessment Method), and BOIN (Bayesian Optimal Interval Design)—based on published literature and practical considerations.

## Performance Metrics
1. Number of Dose Levels
(Current Q1 – not yet contributing to recommendation)
The number of dose levels can influence the suitability of different designs. Further literature is needed to support how varying dose levels affect design performance.

2. Target Toxicity Level
(Current Q2 – not yet contributing to recommendation)

If target toxicity level x is within 0.28–0.35: all designs receive +1.
If
x > 0.35: CRM = +1, BOIN = +1, 3+3 = 0.
If 
x<0.28: CRM = +1, BOIN = +1, 3+3 = 0.
CRM is particularly effective when the true dose lies among higher levels, offering improved accuracy and dose allocation compared to rule-based designs.

3. Confidence in Toxic Dose Estimation
(Current Q6 – contributes to recommendation)

Very confident (good historical data): CRM
Somewhat confident: BOIN
Not confident/limited data: 3+3

4. Importance of Transparent Decision Rules
(Current Q9 – contributes to recommendation)

Very important (regulatory/reproducibility): BOIN
Flexible adaptation preferred: CRM
Simple fixed rules acceptable: 3+3

## Operational Constraints
1. Time/Budget Availability for Trial Setup
(Derived from Current Q7 – contributes to recommendation)

Not limited by time/budget: CRM
Moderate availability: BOIN
Highly constrained: 3+3
CRM requires more setup and statistical expertise, while BOIN offers a balance between complexity and practicality.

## Study Population Characteristics
1. Cohort Size
(Current Q5 – not yet contributing to recommendation)

Cohort size ≠ 3: CRM = +1, BOIN = +1, 3+3 = 0
Cohort size = 3: All designs = +1
The 3+3 design mandates cohorts of exactly three patients.

## Infrastructure Capabilities
1.  Access to Experienced Statistician
(Current Q8 – contributes to recommendation)

Experienced with complex modeling: CRM
Limited support: 3+3 (acts as a “knock-out” variable)
CRM requires advanced statistical expertise, and its adoption is often hindered by lack of familiarity among clinicians and statisticians.
