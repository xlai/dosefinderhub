# Recommendation Questions for DoseFinder Hub
(with references and explanations of how they effect the scoring of the three designs)
On the current questionnaire, there are 9 questions. Of those 9, q6-q9 currently contribute to the recommendation of the trial designs. Some of the following questions are currently in the questionnaire but do not contribute to the recommendation.

There are four catagories of questions going forward that will be weighted in the recommendation:
- Performance metrics (efficacy, safety, statistical power)
- Operational constraints (timeline, budget, regulatory requirements)
- Study population characteristics
- Infrastructure capabilities

### <u>Performance Metrics</u>
1.	How many dose levels are being tested? (Current q1, but not in the recommendation)
Need references for outcomes of different trial designs when it comes to this.

2. What is the target toxicity level for this trial? (current q2, but not in the recommendation)
For 3+3, this is automatically 1/3, so if e.g. 0.28 < x <0.38 then award all designs +1. If outside this range, CRM = +1 and BOIN = +1, 3+3 = 0.

3. How confident are you about which dose might be toxic? (Current q6, in recommendation)
This question could be reworded to “What is the estimated MTD?”, to consider the fact that CRM outperforms 3+3 when MDT is at a higher dose level. Question could also be “Do you suspect MTD to be a higher-level dose?”, with (once references are found) a “higher-dose level” being defined and anything that or above scores for CRM/BOIN?

4. To what degree is the accuracy of DLT desired?  (This is one half of the current question 7)
Prioritises CRM and BOIN over 3+3. Options could be “As close as possible”, “Somewhat” and a third option to account for 3+3

5. How important is it to have pre-specified, transparent decision rules? (Current q9, in recommendation)

### <u>Operational Constraints</u>

1. How much time/budget is available for trial design set up? (this is the other half of current q7)
*"Knock out factor"* If the answer is “limited” = 3+3.

### <u>Study Population Characteristics</u>

1. What is the maximum sample size for this trial? (current q3, but not in the recommendation)

2. What size will the cohorts be? (current q5, but not in the recommendation)

### <u>Infrastructure Capabilities</u>

1. Will you have access to a statistician experienced with dose-finding design? (Current q8, in recommendation)
Would be good as a “knock out variable” where limited access would immediately suggest 3+3

### Below are some possible other questions for consideration that are not currently in the questionnaire:

1. How comfortable are you skipping doses when de-escalating/escalating?
- Was included in the previous questionnaire but am considering that it would be beneficial to bring back.
This question would come under performance metrics, as it is about the design of the trial and how it will be run.
