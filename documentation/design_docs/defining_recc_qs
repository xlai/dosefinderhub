#Recommendation Questions for DoseFinder Hub
(with references and explanations of how they effect the scoring of the three designs)

On the current questionnaire, there are 9 questions. Of those 9, q6-q9 currently contribute to the recommendation of the trial designs. Some of the following questions are currently in the questionnaire but do not contribute to the recommendation.

1.	How many dose levels are being tested? (Current q1, but not in the recommendation)
Need references for outcomes of different trial designs when it comes to this.

2. What is the target toxicity level for this trial? (current q2, but not in the recommendation)
For 3+3, this is automatically 1/3, so if e.g. 0.28 < x <0.38 then award all designs +1. If outside this range, CRM = +1 and BOIN = +1, 3+3 = 0.

3. What is the maximum sample size for this trial? (current q3, but not in the recommendation)

4. How confident are you about which dose might be toxic? (Current q6, in recommendation)
   
This question could be reworded to “What is the estimated MTD?”, to consider the fact that CRM outperforms 3+3 when MDT is at a higher dose level. Question could also be “Do you suspect MTD to be a higher-level dose?”, with (once references are found) a “higher-dose level” being defined and anything that or above scores for CRM/BOIN?

5. How much time/budget is available for trial design set up? (This is one half of the current question 7)
If the answer is “limited” = 3+3.

6. To what degree is the accuracy of DLT desired?  (this is the other half of q7)

Prioritises CRM and BOIN over 3+3. Options could be “As close as possible”, “Somewhat” and a third option to account for 3+3

7. Will you have access to a statistician experienced with dose-finding design? (Current q8, in recommendation)
Would be good as a “knock out variable” where limited access would immediately suggest 3+3

8. How important is it to have pre-specified, transparent decision rules? (Current q9, in recommendation)

###And some possible other questions for consideration that are not currently in the questionnaire:

1.	Do you want trial design to impact the duration of the trial? (Asking about time efficiency)

With this question, there are two options:

-	Either we ask the question and then link the scoring to be dependent on the sample size because if the sample size is larger, CRM outperforms 3+3.
-	 Or this question does not need to be asked, but when answering the question about sample size, CRM scores higher the larger the cohort after a certain point e.g. sample size of 20 or below, all three score the same; anything above and CRM/BOIN start getting + points over 3+3.

2.	How comfortable are you skipping doses when de-escalating/escalating?

Was included in the previous questionnaire but am considering that it would be beneficial to bring back.
