</div>

The Dose-Finder Hub is an innovative, web-based tool developed by the Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit (CTSU) at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), UK, designed to support clinicians and trial designers working in early-phase oncology clinical trials. This platform bridges clinical expertise with advanced statistical methods, offering an accessible, simulation-driven environment to guide optimal trial design.
At the core of the Dose-Finder Hub is a user-friendly questionnaire interface that captures key trial characteristics and clinical preferences. Based on this input, the platform generates tailored simulations comparing multiple dose-escalation strategies. These include:
  
- The traditional 3+3 design
- The model-based Continual Reassessment Method (CRM)
- The model-assisted Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design
  
By visualizing and comparing outcomes from each approach—such as safety, accuracy, and sample size—the Dose-Finder Hub empowers clinical teams to make informed, evidence-based decisions about the most appropriate design for their specific trial context. The platform thus serves as both a decision-support tool and an educational resource, enhancing the adoption of statistically robust methods in early-phase trials.
